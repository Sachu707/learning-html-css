        <p style="color:white;">Mind Empowered (ME) is a charitable organisation for empowerment of youth and women.
          Every Saturday from 4-5 pm on Google Meet, we have an informative and inspirational session with one of our Mind Empowered Coaches who speak to the attendees on a chosen subject of interest to youth and women.

            One of the main goals of the Mind Empowered Charitable Trust is to reduce the stigma 
            surrounding mental health issues. The organization does this by organizing various awareness 
            campaigns and educational programs, which help people understand the importance of mental
             health and the need to seek help when necessary. They also offer counseling services and 
             support groups to help people overcome their mental health challenges. The trust focuses on 
             providing support to individuals who may not have access to mental health services due to 
             financial or social constraints.
         </p>
