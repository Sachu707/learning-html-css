    <p> Mind Empowered (ME) is a charitable organisation for empowerment of youth and women.
       Every Saturday from 4-5 pm on Google Meet, we have an informative and inspirational session with one of our Mind Empowered Coaches who speak to the attendees on a chosen subject of interest to youth and women.

        One of the main goals of the Mind Empowered Charitable Trust is to reduce the stigma 
        surrounding mental health issues. The organization does this by organizing various awareness 
        campaigns and educational programs, which help people understand the importance of mental
         health and the need to seek help when necessary. They also offer counseling services and 
         support groups to help people overcome their mental health challenges. The trust focuses on 
         providing support to individuals who may not have access to mental health services due to 
         financial or social constraints.
     </p>

        It is the brainchild of Maya Menon and her sister - two sisters who resonate positivity and happiness wherever they go.
